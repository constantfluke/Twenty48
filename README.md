# Twenty48
Working version of 2048 written in MATLAB. Future updates to add score, improve usability, add visual appeal. 
The next stage of the project will be to implement AI and test its ability to play the game through various metrics.

Must have MATLAB installed on your machine. Simply download the included files. There are helper functions that move the tiles and a function to create the board.

Run the game from 'game_2048.m.' Use arrow keys (NOT w,a,s,d) to move the tiles. Try to get the largest tile.
